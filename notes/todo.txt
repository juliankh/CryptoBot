TODO:
-make log4j logs rollover to new log files every 24 hours and keep the past 10 log versions
-add to orderbook snapshot tables: spread size (abs), spread size (% of midprice)
-how to make jms msgs persist (like filestore) even after restarting RabbitMQ
-ensure ML uses gpu processors

Potential improvements
-data for ML not querried from db, but is gotten from cache that is updated in live fashion by consuming from jms

Test/Confirm
-the best orderbook depth to use (500?  100?  10?)
