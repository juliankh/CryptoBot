    -xchange orderbook bridge
        -log time lag between snapshot's exchange datetime and now
        -num of snapshots received (whether snapshots from xchange or updates from direct) every minute
    -direct orderbook bridge
        -log whenever get a snapshot

    -how to fix the constant bridge reconnections?

                -amount of data received
                -check if timestamp in the received data is behind the current time by more then a configured limit, in which case alert (is that why reconnections happen?)
                -check how often xchange orderbook bridges have checksum mistaches
            -always get only updates after the initial snapshot?
    -make log4j logs rollover to new log files every 24 hours and keep the past 10 log versions
    -auto-restart processes after restarting computer
    -see how to make the assembled jar smaller (without unnecessary libs) so that the build runs faster
    -if there is no use case to use jms, then remove jms-related code
    -if the snapshot age log msgs show that a time delay develops (presumably because concumption of orderbook data is slower then the rate at which data is sent by the exchange), then look into optimizing the checksum algorithm

    -questions
        -if a feature has no bearing on prediction accuracy, will NN learn to ignore it?  How important is it to omit that feature?
