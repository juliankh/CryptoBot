    -both Direct and XChange: check if timestamp in the received data is behind the current time by more then a configured limit, in which case alert (is that why reconnections happen?)
    -how to fix the constant bridge reconnections?
        -direct websocket connection
            -compare
                -frequency of socket drops
                -amount of data received
            -always get only updates after the initial snapshot?
    -check how slower is the read from redis when it's using large swap
    -make log4j logs rollover to new log files every 24 hours and keep the past 10 log versions
    -auto-restart processes after restarting computer
    -see how to make the assembled jar smaller (without unnecessary libs) so that the build runs faster
    -if there is no use case to use jms, then remove jms-related code
    -if the snapshot age log msgs show that a time delay develops (presumably because processing of orderbook data is slower then the rate at which data is sent by the exchange), then look into optimizing the checksum algorithm
-ML

        -ensure ML uses gpu processors
    -model variations
        -no derived features vs derived features
        -training data range: 10 min, 30 min, 60 min, 120 min

    -questions
        -if a feature has no bearing on prediction accuracy, will NN learn to ignore it?  How important is it to omit that feature?
