    -if the snapshot age log msgs show that a time delay develops (presumably because consumption of orderbook data is slower then the rate at which data is sent by the exchange), then look into optimizing the checksum algorithm
    -make log4j logs rollover to new log files every 24 hours and keep the past 10 log versions

    -see how to make the assembled jar smaller (without unnecessary libs) so that the build runs faster
    -if there is no use case to use jms, then remove jms-related code

        -if a feature has no bearing on prediction accuracy, will NN learn to ignore it?  How important is it to omit that feature?
