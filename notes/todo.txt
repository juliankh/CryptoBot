    -monitor for stuck processes
    -bridges: if no updates for some time, then completely scrap the connection and start completely from scratch (do the same even in the current reconnection logic)
    -check how slower is the read from redis when it's using large swap
    -make java utilities for shell commands like
        -ltro (try to make this a shell command first)
    -how to fix the constant bridge reconnections?
    -make log4j logs rollover to new log files every 24 hours and keep the past 10 log versions

    -questions
        -if a feature has no bearing on prediction accuracy, will NN learn to ignore it?  How important is it to omit that feature?
